    "# Estimating a location parameter\n",
    "It is a common occurrence to have $p(x;\\mu,\\vec\\nu)=f(x-\\mu,\\vec\\nu)$.\n",
    "In this case, $\\mu$ is called a location parameter (and can be multidimensional, depending on the variable $x$).\n",
    "Location estimators are often called _measures of central tendency_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good location estimators are said to be _robust_: this means they yield small _systematic_ uncertainties.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most known location estimator is the sample mean $\\sum_i^N x_i/N$, which is the MLE for many common distributions (Gaussian, exponential, Poisson, etc).\n",
    "It is a consistent estimator of the distribution mean (when it exists), but it actually has issues in many practical applications (e.g. when long tails are present and only a few samples are available it becomes biased):\n",
    "\n",
    " - measuring $\\text dE/\\text dx$ of a particle through a detectors (the Landau distribution is _very_ asymmetric with infinite variance and undefined mean)\n",
    " - calibrating something with limited samples\n",
    " - finding an asymmetric peak over an unknown background\n",
    " - locating a point-like isotropic source with a planar detector (again, the Cauchy distribution has infinite variance and undefined mean)"

    " - If we take a smaller $n$ we weight farther measurements less, so it helps with heavy-tailed distributions.\n",

    " - If we take $n=1$ we get the _sample median_ (the point $x$ with cumulant $F(x)=1/2$).\n",
    " - If we take $n\\to-\\infty$ we get the _sample mode_ (the point closest to its neighbours, that is, the point where the sample density is highest), which is an estimator of the distribution _mode_ (when it is defined and unique). It is completely insensitive to tails and asymmetries.\n",
    "    - $a_{-\\infty}$ is actually a rather unstable estimator of the distribution mode, there are better ones, which can be rather useful and are usually robust, althoug not always easy to compute.\n",
    "    - In binned mode we can use the highest bin of an histogram (here the hard part is deciding the width of the bins).\n",
    "    - We can take the mid-point of the range of width $w$ (fixed) that contains most of the measurements (here choosing $w$ is the hard part).\n",
    "    - In half-range mode (HRM) we recursively take $w$ as half of the previous value, reducing the dependency on the chosen (arbitrary) initial $w$.\n",

    "## The Hodges-Lehmann estimator\n",
    "It builds all possible pairs of data ($n(n-1)/2$), taking the arithmetic mean of each pair, and evaluates the median of the above.\n",
